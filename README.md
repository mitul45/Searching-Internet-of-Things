# Searching Internet of Things
Implementing a novel serach algorithm for Internet of Things.

As a part of my dissertation work, I have designed and implemented a search algorithm for real world. It can be used to find any items like wallet, keys, etc. The implementation was done on Iris motes using TinyOS programing.
